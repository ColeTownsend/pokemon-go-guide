Combat points. The CP of the Pokemon you catch increases as your trainer levels up. You can also increase the CP of your Pokemon by evolving them. At lower levels it is best not worrying about leveling up your Pokemon's CP as you will catch more. Combat points will often double or triple when you evolve your Pokemon.
