Swipe towards the Pokemon on your screen to throw a Pokeball. Your aim and force do matter; your accuracy affects how likely you are to capture a Pokemon especially the more rare or higher level it is. A perfect throw will result in a "nice" prompt on the screen. Using [Incense](/glossary/incense/) surrounds your Trainer with pink-purple smoke and will draw Pokemon towards your for 30 minutes.

###### Pro Tips
The **color of the ring** when attempting to catch a Pokemon relates to the difficulty of catching it. This is often correlated to the Pokemon's CP and/or rareness.
```
Green  : Easy
Yellow : Moderate
Red    : Difficult
```

If you press and hold the Pokeball, the color ring on the Pokemon will start shrinking. When its at its smallest, throw the Pokeball attempting to hit this ring. This is much easier to do when you turn off augmented reality.

You can spin the Pokeball causing it to sparkle. When thrown, it will curve slightly in the direction that you spun it. If you successfully catch the Pokemon with your sparkling ball, you can get a bonus 10 XP.
