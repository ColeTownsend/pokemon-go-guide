Swipe towards the Pokemon on your screen to throw a Pokeball. Your aim and force do matter; your accuracy affects how likely you are to capture a Pokemon especially the more rare or higher level it is. Using [Incense](/pokemon-go-terms/#incense) surrounds your Trainer with pink-purple smoke and will draw Pokemon towards your for 30 minutes.


###### Pro Tips
The **color of the ring** when attempting to catch a Pokemon relates to the difficulty of catching it. This is often correlated to the Pokemon's CP and/or rareness.
```
Green  : Easy
Yellow : Moderate
Red    : Difficult
```

You can spin the Pokeball causing it to sparkle. If you successfully catch the Pokemon with your sparkling ball, you can get a bonus 10 XP.
