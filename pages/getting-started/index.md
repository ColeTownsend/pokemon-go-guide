Note that this game uses a lot of data. It is recommended that you have at least 1gb per month available for steady playing. You may use wifi but the shorter range will limit you.

###### PRO Tip
Pokemon Go has a Battery Saver mode in Settings. To maximize use of Battery Saver turn your phone upside down. The screen should darken and display a Pokemon logo.

## Starting Off
Choose and customize your avatar. After, Professor Oak will walk you through the game. Pokemon go starts off with the traditional Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle choice. Upon choosing one of these pokemon, you must toss a Pokeball at it. Generally the Pokemon will appear in front of you and a light swipe in the direction of the Pokemon will suffice.

###### GET PIKACHU
Pikachu is a hidden fourth choice as a starter. To make Pikachu spawn, walk away from the starters. Getting far enough away will cause them to respawn near you. If you do this enough (a couple times), a Pikachu appears.

###### MAJOR KEY ALERT
**The key to success is [leveling up your trainer](../how-to-level-up/)**. If there is anything you can do to max out your trainer, its generally best to do that. You can find more rare Pokemon and higher level Pokemon, which will give you a better stock of Pokemon to catch and battle with.

## Go Explore
After capturing your starter Pokemon, it's worth exploring your neighborhood or surrounding area for some wild Pokemon and nearby [Pokestops](/glossary/pokestops/). In the lower left hand corner you may see an indicator showing the silhouette of a Pokemon. This is what is "native" to the area you are in. While you can [track pokemon](/how-to-track-pokemon/) as you start it is worth simply interacting with the interface. Please be sure to keep track of your surroundings.

## Level Up First
The key to better game play is focusing on leveling up your trainer. Much higher level Pokemon appear as you level up. When you are a higher level you will see far more new Pokemon which give you a 500xp bonus.

## Save your Stardust
Early on in the game, its tempting to start strengthening your pokemon. Your starter is not that important as you will catch much stronger Pokemon as your trainer levels.

## Save your low level Pokemon
Low level pokemon like Pidgey and Ratata cost very little to evolve. These are worth holdin on to for experience boosts later on.

## Save your Incense and Pokemon modules
These you'll want to use when you get a [Lucky Egg](/glossary/lucky-egg/). The 2x experience multiplier offered by the egg will double all the benefits you get from rapidly catching pokemon.
