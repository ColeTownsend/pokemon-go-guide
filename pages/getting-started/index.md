Note that this game uses a lot of data. It is recommended that you have at least 1gb per month available for steady playing. You may use wifi but the shorter range will limit you.

## Starting Off
Choose and customize your avatar. After, Professor Oak will walk you through the game. Pokemon go starts off with the traditional Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle choice. Upon choosing one of these pokemon, you must toss a Pokeball at it. Generally the Pokemon will appear in front of you and a light swipe in the direction of the Pokemon will suffice.

###### PRO TIP
Pikachu is a hidden fourth choice as a starter. To make Pikachu spawn, walk away from the starters. Getting far enough away will cause them to respawn near you. If you do this enough (a couple times), a Pikachu appears.

## Go Explore
After capturing your starter Pokemon, it's worth exploring your neighborhood or surrounding area for some wild Pokemon and nearby [Pokestops](/glossary/pokestops/). In the lower left hand corner you may see an indicator showing the silhouette of a Pokemon. This is what is "native" to the area you are in. While you can [track pokemon](/how-to-track-pokemon/) as you start it is worth simply interacting with the interface. Please be sure to keep track of your surroundings.

###### PRO Tips
Pokemon Go has a Battery Saver mode in Settings. To maximize use of Battery Saver turn your phone upside down. The screen should darken and display a Pokemon logo.
