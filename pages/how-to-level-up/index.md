## Catching Pokemon
Catching Pokemon yields a base experience of 200xp. There is a possible bonus experience for a total of 600xp if you catch a new Pokemon that is not in your Pokedex. This is one of the most effective ways to level up your trainer.

## Evolving Pokemon
Evolving Pokemon yields a 500xp bonus. To maximize the amount of evolves you can do, evolve more lower level Pokemon rather than trying to get it to its final evolution. For example, its better to evolve 4 Pidgey's into Pidgeotto's than it is to evolve a single Pidgeotto into a Pidgeot.

## Eggs
Walking around with eggs and hatching them both yield better Pokemon and experience. A Lucky Egg can be used to multiply the experience received but that is rather hard to time.

## Pokestops
While walking around in highly populated or travelled areas you'll find blue towers. Walking closely to these you'll see them transform into a Pokeball shape. Tap this and spin the image "coin" to receive items and experience. This is an easy way early game to get experience and items. Later game they're not worth much for experience.

## Gyms
Attacking a gym will earn you experience. Defending a gym will earn you experience and stardust for successfully defending and holding a team gym, if you have a Pokemon garrisoned there.

###### Pro Tips
Getting a Lucky Egg gives you a 30 minute period of double experience. Wait to evolve your Pokemon until you get a lucky Egg and double your experience!
