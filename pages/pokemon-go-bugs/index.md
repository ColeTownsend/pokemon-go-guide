### Three Step Bug
A pokemon will always appear three steps away, no matter how far in any direction you move.

### The Curving Pokeball
If you swipe the ball straight, but to the end of your screen, it will curve.

### Capture Freeze
When you are capturing a pokemon, the ball will not shake but the cut scene continues. Restarting the app will take you out of the capture mode and you may or may not have caught the pokemon.
