## Leveling a Pokemon
Capture the same type Pokemon to earn Stardust and Candy. Each Pokemon require different amounts of Stardust and Candy to either level up or evolve. Transferring Pokemon to the Professor will earn you one candy. You can view how much Stardust or Candy required by viewing your caught Pokemon.

## Evolving a Pokemon
Usually Pokemon require a set number of Candies to evolve. Follow the same steps outlined above to acquire Candy.
