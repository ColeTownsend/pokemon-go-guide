### 1. How to start with Pikachu
To start with Pikachu, walk away from the 3 initial starting Pokemon. They will disappearing and reappear near you. Repeat this until PIikachu appears.

### 2. More easily catch Pokemon
If you press and hold the Pokeball, a color ring on the Pokemon will start shrinking. When its at its smallest, throw the Pokeball attempting to hit this ring. This is much easier to do when you turn off augmented reality.

### 3. Experience Bomb
If you are lucky enough to get a lucky egg, or have reached level 9 and received one, go to Lure Modules and use Incense to maximize Pokemon attraction. You will receive double XP for all the pokemon you catch. Also if you have Pokemon you can evolve, especially cheap low level ones, do those as well. You'll likely jump up a few levels as a result.

### 4. Tap a pokemon with no footprints to see it
A pokemon with no footprints should appear near you. If it hasn't showed up, click the pokemon tracker in the lower right hand corner of your device and select the pokemon that has no foot steps. This should prompt it to appear.

### 5. Turn off Augmented reality
When trying to catch a Pokemon it is much easier to have a good throw if you turn off augmented reality.

### 6. Dodge in battle
Swiping left or right while in battle lets you dodge your opponents bigger attacks. Wait until they seem to be "charging up" their attack and swipe at the last moment to a side.

### 7. Use your high power attack in battle
Tap and hold on the opposing pokemon to use one of your high damage attacks. The blue bars in the upper right hand corner shows you how many times you can use this attack and how long until it recharges.

### 8. If you have wifi, toggle it off and see if you move
Sometimes your phone GPS will move you around if you toggle between data and wifi. If you're stationed at a cafe or building with wifi, sometimes you can reach a nearby pokestop simple by connecting or disconnecting to a local wifi network.

### 9. Better throws mean more XP
You can get up to a 100xp throw bonus for an excellent throw. Tap and hold your pokeball and watch the colored target on the pokemon shrink. The smaller the target that you hit inside, the better your bonus. There are three bonuses, nice, great, and excellent that yield 10, 50, and 100xp respectively.

### 10. Pay attention
The Pokemon loading screen is no joke. Pay attention to your surroundings and please do not play while you drive.
