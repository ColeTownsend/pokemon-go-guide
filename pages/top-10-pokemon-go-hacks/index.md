### How to start with Pikachu
To start with Pikachu, walk away from the 3 initial starting Pokemon. They will disappearing and reappear near you. Repeat this until PIikachu appears.

### More easily catch Pokemon
If you press and hold the Pokeball, a color ring on the Pokemon will start shrinking. When its at its smallest, throw the Pokeball attempting to hit this ring. This is much easier to do when you turn off augmented reality.

### Experience Bomb
If you are lucky enough to get a lucky egg, or have reached level 9 and received one, go to Lure Modules and use Incense to maximize Pokemon attraction. You will receive double XP for all the pokemon you catch. Also if you have Pokemon you can evolve, especially cheap low level ones, do those as well. You'll likely jump up a few levels as a result.
